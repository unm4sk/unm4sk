I'm Daniil Lysenko, and I am a student. I enjoy writing code using my favorite programming languages, such as Python, Flutter and C++. Interestingly, I see programming as a universal language, which can help people to make the world brighter, better and simpler. By building my own projects, I try to impact the world in a good way by implementing my knowledge in very serious projects or fun ones.

Skills: PYTHON / C++ / FLUTTER / LINUX

- 🔭 I’m currently working on My YouTube channel & a *secret*, but very **cool** project! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python & Flutter
